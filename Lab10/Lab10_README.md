# **Lab 10 - Priority Queue ADT using Max Heap**
## **Overview**
In this lab, you will implement a **Priority Queue ADT** using a **max heap**.

## **Program 1 - Polycarp and distinct sequence**
## **Overview**
Given a sequence of integers, the goal is to determine the minimum number of elements that must be removed from the beginning of the sequence so that all remaining elements are distinct.
### **Input**
- An integer `t` — the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - An integer `n` — the length of the sequence.
  - A sequence of `n` integers `a1, a2, ..., an` (1 ≤ ai ≤ n).

### **Output**
- For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements to remove.

## **Program 2- Score of word game**
### **Objective**
For each test case, compute the total points of each player according to the scoring rules.

### **Input**
- An integer `t` — the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - An integer `n` — number of words per player.
  - Three lines, each containing `n` distinct 3-letter lowercase words (per player).

### **Output**
- For each test case, output three integers — points of player 1, player 2, and player 3.

## **Program 3 - Priority Queue ADT using Max Heap**

### **Objective**
Design a menu-driven program to implement a **Priority Queue ADT** using a **max heap**. The program will support the following operations:
1. **Insert**: Add an element to the queue.
2. **Delete**: Remove the maximum element (root of the heap).
3. **Display**: Display the elements of the queue.
4. **Search**: Search for a specific element in the queue.
5. **Sort (Heap Sort)**: Sort the elements of the queue using heap sort.
6. **Exit**: Exit the program.

### **Input/Output**
**Input**: Integer elements to be inserted or searched within the priority queue.

**Output**: Depending on the operation, the program will either display the queue, search result, or the sorted queue.
