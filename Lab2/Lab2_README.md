# **Lab 2 - Classes and Pointers Recap**

## **Overview**  
This lab focuses on the application of Dynamic Memory Allocation  and Class-based design in C++. Programs emphasize number-based problems and area calculations using classes and pointers.

## **Program 1 - Check number is palindrome/armstrong/perfect**

### **Overview**  
This program determines whether a number is a **Palindrome**, an **Armstrong Number**, or a **Perfect Number** using **dynamic memory allocation** (no normal variables or arrays).

### **Supported Operations**  
This is a **menu-driven program** that supports the following operations:

- **Palindrome** — Check if a number reads the same backward and forward  
- **Armstrong Number** — Check if a number is equal to the sum of the cubes of its digits  
- **Perfect Number** — Check if a number is equal to the sum of its proper divisors  
- **Exit** — Terminate the program  

## **Program 2 - Area Calculator**

### **Overview**  
This program calculates and displays the area of various geometric shapes using **class-based design** and appropriate **member functions** and **data members**.

### **Supported Operations**  
This is a **menu-driven program** that supports the following operations:

- **Square** — Calculate area of a square  
- **Cube** — Calculate surface area of a cube  
- **Rectangle** — Calculate area of a rectangle  
- **Cuboid** — Calculate surface area of a cuboid  
- **Exit** — Terminate the program
