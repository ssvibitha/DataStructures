# Lab 1 - Sorting and Searching Algorithms
## Overview
This lab involves implementing a menu-driven program with sorting and searching algorithms in C++. The first program sorts an array using three algorithms, and the program integrates these algorithms with search functions using a header file.

## Program 1 - Sorting Menu
### Objective
Implement a menu-driven program to sort an array using Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.

### Input/Output
Input: Unsorted array of integers and menu option to choose sorting method.

Output: Sorted array.

## Program 2 - Searching Menu
### Objective
Create a new program that uses sorting functions from a header file and allows Linear Search and Binary Search on the sorted array.

### Input/Output
Input: Unsorted array of integers and a target to search for.

Output: Index of the target (if found) or a not-found message.
