# **Lab 4 - List ADT (Singly Linked List)**

## **Overview**  
This lab implements the List ADT using singly linked lists. The programs cover fundamental list operations and advanced list manipulations including reverse traversal and merging sorted lists.

## **Program 1 - List ADT using Singly Linked List**

### **Overview**  
This menu-driven program manages a singly linked list and supports various insertion, deletion, and utility operations.

### **Supported Operations**

- **Insert Beginning** — Insert a node at the start of the list  
- **Insert End** — Insert a node at the end of the list  
- **Insert Position** — Insert a node at a specific position  
- **Delete Beginning** — Delete the first node  
- **Delete End** — Delete the last node  
- **Delete Position** — Delete a node at a specific position  
- **Search** — Search for an element in the list  
- **Display** — Display all elements in forward order  
- **Display Reverse** — Display all elements in reverse order (without reversing links)  
- **Reverse Link** — Reverse the linked list (modifies the link directions)  
- **Exit** — Terminate the program  

## **Program 2 - Sorted List and Merge using Singly Linked List**

### **Overview**  
This program demonstrates sorted insertion and merging of two sorted lists using singly linked lists. 

### **Supported Operations (Header File Program)**

- **Insert Ascending** — Insert a node so that the list remains in ascending order  
- **Merge** — Merge two sorted lists into a third sorted list  
- **Display** — Display the elements of the list  
- **Exit** — Terminate the program  

### **Supported Operations (Main Program with 3 Lists)**

- **Insert List1** — Insert into the first list (ascending order)  
- **Insert List2** — Insert into the second list (ascending order)  
- **Merge into List3** — Merge List1 and List2 into List3 (ascending order)  
- **Display** — Display all three lists  
- **Exit** — Terminate the program
