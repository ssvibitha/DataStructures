# Lab 12 - Graph ADT
## **Overview** 
This lab focuses on the implementation of the adjacency matrix and adjacency list as a part of graph ADT and implementing algorithms such as Prim's, Kruskal's and Dijkstra's Algorithm

## **Program 1 - Adjacency Matrix**
### **Overview**
This program implements a graph using an **Adjacency Matrix** representation.
### **Supported Operations**  
- **Insert** — Add a new edge to the graph  
- **Delete** — Remove an existing edge from the graph  
- **Search** — Check whether an edge exists between two vertices  
- **Display** — Show the current graph (Adjacency Matrix representation)  

## **Program 2 - Adjacency List**
### **Overview**
This program implements a graph using an **Adjacency List** representation. 
### **Supported Operations**  
- **Insert** — Add a new edge to the graph  
- **Delete** — Remove an existing edge from the graph  
- **Search** — Check whether an edge exists between two vertices  
- **Display** — Show the current graph (Adjacency List representation)  
## **Program 3 - Graph Algorithms **
### **Overview**
This program implements three fundamental graph algorithms:
- **Prim's Algorithm** (Minimum Spanning Tree)  
- **Kruskal's Algorithm** (Minimum Spanning Tree)  
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** (Single-Source Shortest Path)

### **Supported Operations**
- Compute Minimum Spanning Tree using Prim's Algorithm  
- Compute Minimum Spanning Tree using Kruskal's Algorithm  
- Find Shortest Path from a source vertex using Dijkstra's Algorithm
